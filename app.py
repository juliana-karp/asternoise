            in phone cameras, digital cameras, and modern telescopes.')
st.markdown('A CCD is an electronic device which uses semiconductors to \
            detect incident photons above a certain energy threshhold. \
            The semiconductors begin in a de-excited ground state, \
            meaning that the electrons in their outer shell are \
            bound to the atom in the valence band. When an incident \
            photon hits the semiconductor, its energy is absorbed, which \
            causes an electron in the valence band to jump energy levels \
            up to the conduction band. Over time, as many photons hit the \
            semiconductor, these negative charges accumulate and \
            create a global negative electric charge in the material \
            whose magnitude is proportional to the number of incident \
            absorbed photons.')
st.markdown('Using this technique, we are only able to quantify the the total number \
            of incident photons within a single semiconductor, not their \
            individual positions. Therefore, in order to take an image, the CCD is \
            divided into many tiny square wells, each with their own semiconductor. \
            Within each individual well, the charge buildup is summed and a singular \
            value is recorded. These wells correspond to the pixels of a \
            digital image. To obtain higher resolution data, the same total CCD \
            surface area must be divided into a greater number of wells. \
            Before they become a digital image, however, the charge buildups \
            in each well must be read out by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), recorded \
            digitally, and finally stored in data formats we are familiar with.')

st.markdown('### Background Sky Noise')
st.markdown('When observing an astronomical object, not all of the light we measure \
            is actually coming from the object itself. The sky has a background brightness \
            that must be taken into account. Even in areas of the sky that appear completely \
            dark, the background sky value is never zero. It is also not simply a constant value -- \
            which, ideally, could simply be subtracted from the dataset. Rather, the \
            background sky value can be visualized as a gaussian profile of random values \
            distributed about a mean, which the user can choose in the demonstration below. \
            In each pixel, the background sky value corresponds to a random value probabilistically \
            sampled from the gaussian distribution.')

st.markdown('### Read Noise')
st.markdown('At the end of each exposure, the excess charge which \
            has accumulated in each pixel well must be read \
            out before it can be converted to a digital format by \
            the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This process occurs \
            pixel by pixel, and therefore takes time. Since the ADC is \
            an electrical component, it produces its own heat, meaning photons. \
            These photons are then recorded by the CCD as part of its measurement, \
            therefore adding noise to the data. This noise is called read noise, \
            and is present in every image taken by CCDs.')

            B is the noise from the sky background and R is the \

            written as:')
st.markdown('### $S \div N = S \div \sqrt{S + B + R^2}$')
st.markdown('The signal and sky background values are a function \
            of the exposure time, but the read noise is an instrinsic \
            value of the CCD and does not depend on exposure time.')

            data is :violet[signal-limited]. The signal-to-noise \
            ratio increases with more light collection power. \
            In this scenario, increased exposure time and larger aperture \
            telescopes can help increase the signal-to-noise ratio.')

            can be improved by taking data during darker phases of the moon.')
