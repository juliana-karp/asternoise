st.markdown('A CCD is an electronic device which uses semiconductors to \
            detect incident photons above a certain energy threshhold. \
            The semiconductors begin in a de-excited ground state,\
            meaning that the electrons in their outer shell are \
            bound to the atom in the valence band. When an \
            incident photon hits the semiconductor, \
            its energy is absorbed, which causes an electron \
            in the valence band to jump energy levels up to the\
            conduction band. Over time, as many photons hit the\
            semiconductor, these negative charges accumulate and \
            create a global negative electric charge in the material\
            whose magnitude is proportional to the number of incident\
            absorbed photons.')
st.markdown('In order to record an image, the CCD is divided into many\
            tiny square wells, each with their own semiconductor. \
            These wells become the pixels on a digital image. Within \
            each individual well, the charge buildup is summed, so in \
            order to obtain higher resolution data, the same total CCD \
            surface area must be divided into a greater number of wells. \
            Finally, using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the \
            charge buildups in each well are read out, recorded \
            digitally, and stored in data formats we are familiar with.')

            gaussian profile of random values distributed about a mean, \
            which the user can choose below. In each pixel, a random \

st.markdown('### Read Noise')
st.markdown('At the end of each exposure, the excess charge which \
            has been accumulated in each pixel well must be read \
            out before it can be converted to a digital format by \
            the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This process occurs \
            pixel by pixel, and therefore takes some time. The ADC is \
            an electrical component which produces its own heat, \
            meaning that it can add noise to the data that it is \
            recording. This noise is called read noise, and is present \
            in every image recorded by CCDs.')

            B is the noise from the sky background and R is the \
            read noise, then the total signal to noise can be \
            written as:')

            of the exposure time, but the read noise is an instrinsic \
            value of the CCD and does not depend on exposure time.')

#define signal-dominated, noise-dominated regions
st.markdown('* When $S/N$ scales with $S / \sqrt{S}$, we say the \
            data is :violet[signal-limited]. The signal-to-noise \
            ratio increases with more light collection power, \
            meaning increased exposure time and larger aperture \
            telescopes can increase this ratio.')
st.markdown('* When $S/N$ scales with $S / \sqrt{B}$, we say the \
            data is :violet[background-limited]. If the data is \
            background-limited, it is often in the case of faint \
            targets. Imaging during darker phases of the moon can help \
            decrease noise in this scenario.')
